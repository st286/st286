#  Installing and Configuring WireGuard® on Linux as a VPN server

## 安装 WireGuard

添加 back­ports 源
```
apt install curl lsb-release -y
echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian $(lsb_release -sc)-backports main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list
apt update
```
安装网络工具包
```
apt install net-tools iproute2 openresolv dnsutils -y
```
安装 wireguard-tools ((Wire­Guard 配置工具：wg、wg-quick)
```
apt install wireguard-tools --no-install-recommends
```
先执行 uname -r 命令查看内核版本。如果是 5.6 以上内核则已经集成了 Wire­Guard ，就不需要安装了。如果不是，执行下面的命令
```
apt -t $(lsb_release -sc)-backports install linux-image-$(dpkg --print-architecture) linux-headers-$(dpkg --print-architecture) --install-recommends -y
```
重启
```
reboot
```
查看版本（ 5.6 以上就可以了）
```
uname -r
```

## Configuring WireGuard Server

The first step is to choose an IP range which will be used by the server. The private IP ranges defined by the RFC 19198 are the following:
```
   10.0.0.0/8
   172.16.0.0/12
   192.168.0.0/16
   
   fd00::/8
```

### Generating private and public keys

WireGuard works by encrypting the connection using a pair of cryptographic keys. The keypair is used by sharing the public key with the other party who then can encrypt their message in such a way that it can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. To make the communication secure both ways, each party needs to have their own private and public keys as each pair only enables one-way messaging.

For the use in WireGuard, the server and each client must generate their own key pair and then exchange public keys.

To get started with generating the keys for the server change into the WireGuard directory.

Next, set the permissions for the directory with the following command. Note that you need to be logged in with the root account to do this.

```
cd /etc/wireguard
umask 077
```
Then with the required permissions set, generate a new key pair with the command below.
```
wg genkey | tee s-privatekey | wg pubkey > s-publickey
wg genkey | tee c1-privatekey | wg pubkey > c1-publickey
wg genkey | tee c2-privatekey | wg pubkey > c2-publickey
wg genkey | tee c3-privatekey | wg pubkey > c3-publickey
wg genkey | tee c4-privatekey | wg pubkey > c4-publickey
```
Repeat these steps on each client you want to connect to the WireGuard server.

Remember that you should never share your private key with anyone.


### Generate server config

We are then set to start configuring the WireGuard server. The config files are generally stored in /etc/wireguard folder. Create a new configuration file called wg0.conf in that folder.
```
nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```
The configuration below will make your WireGuard server accept connections to 51820 and allow a client with the public key corresponding to the private key we made above.

Add the following directives to the configuration file. Replace "eth0" by your main network interface if it is not "eth0".
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <contents-of-server-privatekey>
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
Address = fd00:abcd:abcd:4321::1/64

PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

PostUp = ip6tables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = ip6tables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

ListenPort = 51920

[Peer]
PublicKey = <contents-of-client1-publickey>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
AllowedIPs = fd00:abcd:abcd:4321::2/128

[Peer]
PublicKey = <contents-of-client2-publickey>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3/32
AllowedIPs = fd00:abcd:abcd:4321::3/128
```

### IP forwarding

Next, to be able to connect through your WireGuard server, you’ll need to enable packet forwarding. This is only done on the WireGuard server and not necessary for any clients.

Open the system variables file for edit.
```
nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```
Then uncomment the following line by removing the # at the beginning of the line.
```
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
```
Once done, save the file and exit the editor.

Then apply the new option with the command below.
```
sysctl -p
```


### Starting WireGuard and enabling it at boot
```
wg-quick up wg0
wg-quick down wg0

wg show

systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
systemctl start wg-quick@wg0

```

## Client configuration 

On a client computer, create a new configuration file "wg0.conf". Then add the following to the file "wg0.conf".

```
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.2/32
Address = fd00:abcd:abcd:4321::2/128
PrivateKey = <contents-of-client-privatekey>
DNS = 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = <contents-of-server-publickey>
Endpoint = <server-public-ip or domain>:51920
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0

PersistentKeepalive = 25

```
Note that setting AllowedIPs to 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 will forward all traffic over the WireGuard VPN connection. If you want to only use WireGuard for specific destinations, set their IP address ranges in the list separated by a comma.

PersistentKeepalive tells WireGuard to send a UDP packet every 25 seconds, this is useful if you are behind a NAT and you want to keep the connection alive.

## Configuring firewall rules

You should also configure a firewall to block any unwanted connections and keep your server secure. You can do this by either installing a software firewall on your cloud server or by using the Firewall service at your UpCloud Control Panel.

For Ubuntu servers, you can install the ufw, the Uncomplicated Firewall, using the command below.
```
apt install ufw
```
Next, add the following rules to allow SSH and WireGuard connections.
```
ufw allow ssh
ufw allow 51920/udp
```
Enable the firewall with the next command.
```
ufw enable
```
Then confirm the command when prompted.

Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Afterwards, you can check the active firewall rules with the command below.
```
ufw status
```
