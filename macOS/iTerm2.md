### iTerm2 shell integration was installed!

A script was installed to /Users/st/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh
Utilities were installed to /Users/st/.iterm2. You don't need to modify your PATH because /Users/st/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh includes aliases for them.

To make it work right now, do:

  source /Users/st/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh

This line was also added to /Users/st/.zshrc, so the next time you log in it will be loaded automatically.
